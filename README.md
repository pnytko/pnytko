I'm interested in automatization and computational programs. 

I have some experience in:

- Python - Anaconda, Jupyter, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pillow, opencv
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript - very basic JS, OpenLayers6
- OS - Windows (any version), some experience with Linux Ubuntu/Arch, work with terminal (bash/fish)
- Other tools - efficient data manipulation in Total Commander, Adobe Photoshop (v.g. knowledge), Figma (UI design), VS Code (basic usage)
